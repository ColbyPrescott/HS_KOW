    Move all mirroring to path setup functions
    
    Moved the target point mirroring code from APS::TickDriving() to APS::AddPathPoint(...).
    This makes things more consistent with how APS::SetPosition(...) and other setup functions mirror their inputs, and also slightly faster because the mirrored coordinate doesn't need to be calculated every tick; the autonomous isn't going to become unmirrored in the middle of driving.

    Autonomous day 1 revisions
    
    Tweaked AutonNegativeRed in a variety of different ways to make it run better. It still never executed 100% perfectly for one reason or another, but... at least it's mostly there. Also created AutonNegativeBlue that just mirrors AutonNegativeRed.
    This commit just serves as a backup.

    Create prototype autonNegativeRed
    
    Created an outline for the - Red autonomous. This should theoretically work, but it will need to be tweaked to fix oversights and make it more consistent.
    This commit serves as a benchmark for future tweaks and a backup for the theoretical autonomous sequence.

    Rewrite clawArm subsystem to stop over expansion
    
    Holding the up button will now raise the clawArm in three different segments. First turning the claw, then the arm, then letting the claw back out as the arm goes up higher.
    This stops the arm and claw from extending past expansion limits. The robot is over 24 inches wide when the arm is extended to its fullest, but this code prohibits that from happening.

    Combine lift and clawPivot into clawArm
    
    Copied the code for the two separate subsystems into one subsystem. Also renamed the lift to the arm to match the rest of the notebook better.
    Both of these subsystems do very similar things, might as well make them the same. Refactoring the make a combined control setup is also the next todo, so this is step one.

    Accurate movement will only be achieved with accurate measurements! The software must know what hardware it has to work with in order to do the right thing.

    Add separate speeds for automatic and manual clawPivot controls
    
    Claw will now move at 26 rpm while rotating with the L1 and L2 lift, and 60 rpm when using R1 and R2 manual controls.
    This makes manual controls useful again, as it no longer takes forever to adjust the angle.

    Re-added the the R1 and R2 manual controls for the clawPivot motor. It will still be controlled automatically, but manual control can be taken if needed.
    Manual control helps adjust the angle better, in case trying to put the ring onto a mobile goal or something from the claw which is a different height.

    Bind clawPivot controls to L1 and L2 like lift
    
    Set the clawPivot to use the same buttons as the lift, making it automatically go to an optimum angle when grabbing or placing a ring.
    Having to line up two different systems to put a ring onto the wall stakes is work that can be reduced. Controlling both at the same time will make it faster and more consistent.

    Add reset button
    
    Set the A button to trigger a reset routine on the lift and clawPivot. This routine will lower the torque and move the motors as far against another part of the robot as possible, then reset the encoders to zero.
    Sometimes, I think when the brain draws too much power or something, out lift mechanisms suddenly power off for a second. If alignment between the lift and clawPivot is to be synced, there needs to be a button to manually sync them again in the event of this power issue.

    Abbreviations technically aren't a best coding practice. If they are to be used, they should be used everywhere consistently. autonSelector.cpp has more display code than autonomous code.

    Pre-autonomous would freeze and not finish due to field control locking the intake motors. Moved the intake rotate functions into user init, plus a few other tweaks to remove the convinience setup features.
    Pre-autonomous freezing meant that main() would pause until autonomous, never properly showing the autonomous selection screen.

    intake.cpp had the order of hooks backwards, leading to the incorrect measurements being used. Switched two plus signs to minus signs to fix the issue.
    While depositing a ring, the hook over or undershooting the target waypoint would occasionally result in failure. The issue also created drift, with error growing over time and making it completely impossible to score a ring with the automatic trigger intake buton.

    Backwards driving was added to stop the robot from rotating a lot once it gets super close to the target, but it skips targets now. In a path, it was causing many left turns to turn excessively.

    I looked into making custom regions in VS Code. Regions seem like they're a standardized feature in VSCode, but I couldn't get them working for some reason. The region VS Code extension from maptz fixed them, and I also stumbled across the "Colored Regions" extension by mihelcic to help highlight the regions.
    The headers were becoming harder to see in intake.cpp as more code was added. An extra layer of organization may benefit the HS_KOW project.

    Replace forwards / backwards intake controls with single button logic waypoints
    
    Removed the old prototype arrow button controls for the intake. Polished up the WIP waypoint system to use MoveClosestHookToWaypoint(...) and TriggerIntake().
    The waypoint system will ensure rings can be picked up quickly, without the hook arriving late (wasted time) or early (slaps ring farther away). Mapping the intake to a single button should simplify controls and make them more intuitive. If the driver wants the intake to move, click the "move intake" button.

    Rename intakeConveyor to intake
    
    Renamed files, variables, and edited comments to refer to the intake and chain system as simply the intake instead of the intake and conveyor.
    Now that the intake has existed on the robot for a longer amount of time, we've come to a general consensus on the name.

    Add scale to APS so it reports position in inches instead of degrees
    
    Added degreesToInchesRatio in APS constructor. This number is multiplied with wheel travel in APS::Tick().
    Position being measured in degrees makes no sense. Distances should match the unit from the game manual, inches.

    Move InertialIntercept class to its own file
    
    Split dualInertial.h into two files. Made InertialIntercept inherit vex::inertial with protected visibility and implemented all methods manually. Inertial bias has been moved from DualInertial to InertialIntercept. Final inertial biases were calculated too.
    Combining two inertial sensors together into one object should be completely separate from bias correction math. If DualInertial has to reimplement many of the functions, InertialIntercept will too.

    Test if temperature affects inertial sensors
    
    Clicking the X button will log current time, expected rotation, measured rotation, and temperature. Log, spin 5 revolutions, repeat 20 times. Wrote results at bottom of robotConfig.cpp. Results show no correlation between temperature and inertial bias.
    If the temperature affects the inertial sensor, correction will be more complicated than a simple bias multiplication.

    Add InertialIntercept class to expose the vex::inertial::temperature() function
    
    Created a class in dualInertial.h to replace the vex::inertial class. This new class has a public GetTemperature() method.
    In the few 18000 degree tests I've done so far, it seems like the results can vary. I wonder if this is a result of the sensors heating up over time. This intercept class will allow me to track temperature in my tests.

    Add bias to inertial sensors
    
    Added a bias multiplier value for the rotation of each inertial sensor. Still need to be tuned.
    When only one sensor was plugged in, I noticed that 6 revolutions would offset the sensor by about 10 degrees every time, no matter speed or acceleration. Accounting for this might improve APS.

    The robot will slightly turn while driving forwards. This bias will encourage all the motors to spin at the same speed.

    The tracking math assumes that the drive math is correct, but I never actually proved if it's correct. Now I know it is correct, so the tracking issues must be from something else!

    Add second inertial sensor and create DualInertial class
    
    Added a second inertial sensor to the robot. Replaced the vex::inertial variables with a custom DualInertial class that can return the average between two sensors. Added utilityMath.h. Also switched the APS to use radians instead of degrees.
    Having two inertial sensors will supposedly reduce drift.

    Controller inputs are not the issue, and the instructions are not the issue. Whatever was the issue appears to have resolved itself?

    Test if slowing conveyor helps aim disks
    
    Clicking the left arrow button will now set the intake conveyor to half speed.
    Theory is that full speed works well to get disks on the alliance stake, but overshoots the mogo. Perhaps slowing it down will more accurately land the mogo without a permanent physical fix?
